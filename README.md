Data and pre-computed results are available at https://osf.io/bdf74/

Python code was tested and run using python version 3.10.8 on Linux and Windows. It requires numpy, scipy, seaborn, pandas, and sklearn.
The Matlab code was tested and run using Matlab 2020b on Linux (but Windows should work as well).

All analyses were run on a standard, if quite powerful 48 computing threads, computer. 16GB ram and multi-core CPU should be enough to run all analyses.

Run the scripts related to figure 1 of the paper in the order described in the file names (first run the matlab script, then the python script). 
The scripts re-produce all figures in the manuscript. The results related to these figures can either be re-computed (will take several hours), or the pre-computed results can be loaded in instead.
